# Amazon Q Integration

This directory contains Amazon Q configuration for the Cat Weight Tracker project, providing consistent AI assistance across the development team.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Use saved prompts in your Amazon Q conversations with the `@prompt` syntax:

```text
@cat-weight-tracker-assistant
```

## 📁 Available Prompts

- **`@cat-weight-tracker-assistant`** - General project assistance
- **`@backend-dev`** - FastAPI/Python development help
- **`@frontend-dev`** - React/TypeScript development help

## 🔧 How It Works

- **`prompts/`** - Saved prompts for specific development tasks
- **`rules/`** - Automatically applied context and guidelines
- **Project files** - Additional context documents for comprehensive assistance

## 💡 Best Practices

1. **Use specific prompts** for specialized tasks
2. **Reference current code** when asking for modifications
3. **Update prompts** as the project evolves
4. **Share improvements** with the team by committing changes

## 🎯 Getting the Most Value

- Start conversations with the appropriate prompt
- Provide specific context about what you're working on
- Ask for code that follows the project's patterns and standards
- Request explanations of complex implementations

The configuration ensures Amazon Q understands the project structure, coding standards, and development patterns for more accurate and helpful responses.
