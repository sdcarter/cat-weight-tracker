# Performance Guidelines

## Backend Performance (FastAPI/Python)

### Database Optimization
- Use database indexes on frequently queried columns
- Implement proper pagination for large datasets
- Use eager loading for related data to avoid N+1 queries
- Consider database connection pooling
- Monitor slow queries and optimize them

### API Performance
- Implement response caching where appropriate
- Use async/await for I/O operations
- Implement request/response compression
- Add proper HTTP caching headers
- Use background tasks for long-running operations

### Memory Management
- Use generators for large data processing
- Implement proper connection cleanup
- Monitor memory usage and optimize data structures
- Use lazy loading for expensive operations

### Code Optimization
- Profile code to identify bottlenecks
- Use appropriate data structures (sets vs lists)
- Minimize database queries in loops
- Cache expensive computations

## Frontend Performance (React/TypeScript)

### Component Optimization
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement proper key props for lists
- Use useMemo and useCallback for expensive calculations
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders

### Bundle Optimization
- Use code splitting with React.lazy
- Implement tree shaking to remove unused code
- Optimize images and assets
- Use proper chunk splitting strategies

### State Management
- Minimize global state
- Use local state when possible
- Implement proper state normalization
- Avoid deep object nesting in state

### Network Optimization
- Implement request caching
- Use proper loading states
- Implement request deduplication
- Use optimistic updates where appropriate

## Database Performance

### Query Optimization
- Use appropriate indexes
- Avoid SELECT * queries
- Use LIMIT for large result sets
- Implement proper JOIN strategies

### Schema Design
- Normalize data appropriately
- Use appropriate data types
- Consider denormalization for read-heavy operations
- Implement proper foreign key constraints

### Connection Management
- Use connection pooling
- Monitor connection usage
- Implement proper timeout settings
- Use read replicas for read-heavy operations

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Application Metrics
- Monitor response times
- Track error rates
- Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory)
- Implement health checks

### Database Metrics
- Monitor query performance
- Track connection pool usage
- Monitor database size and growth
- Implement query logging for slow queries

### Frontend Metrics
- Monitor Core Web Vitals
- Track bundle sizes
- Monitor runtime performance

- Regular performance regression testing
- Monitor performance over time
- Set performance budgets

## Caching Strategies

### Backend Caching
- Implement Redis for session storage
- Cache expensive database queries
- Use HTTP caching headers
- Implement application-level caching

### Frontend Caching
- Use browser caching effectively
- Implement service worker caching
- Cache API responses appropriately
- Use CDN for static assets

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- Design stateless applications
- Use load balancers effectively
- Implement proper session management
- Consider microservices architecture

### Vertical Scaling
- Monitor resource usage
- Optimize resource allocation
- Use appropriate instance sizes
- Implement auto-scaling policies

## Performance Best Practices

### Development Practices
- Profile before optimizing
- Measure performance impact of changes
- Use performance budgets
- Implement performance monitoring in CI/CD

### Code Review Focus
- Review for performance implications
- Check for potential memory leaks
- Validate database query efficiency
- Ensure proper error handling doesn't impact performance

### Production Monitoring
- Set up alerting for performance degradation
- Monitor user experience metrics
- Track business metrics affected by performance
- Implement automated performance testing
