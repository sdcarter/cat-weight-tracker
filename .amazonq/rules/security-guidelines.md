# Security Guidelines

## Authentication & Authorization

### JWT Token Management
- Use secure, randomly generated secret keys
- Set appropriate token expiration times (default: 30 minutes)
- Implement token refresh mechanisms
- Never store tokens in localStorage for sensitive applications
- Use httpOnly cookies when possible

### Password Security
- Use bcrypt or similar for password hashing
- Enforce strong password requirements
- Implement rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- Add account lockout after failed attempts

### API Security
- Validate all input data using Pydantic schemas
- Implement proper CORS configuration
- Use HTTPS in production
- Add request rate limiting
- Implement proper error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information

## Database Security

### SQL Injection Prevention
- Always use SQLAlchemy ORM queries
- Never construct raw SQL with user input
- Use parameterized queries when raw SQL is necessary
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use environment variables for database credentials
- Implement proper database user permissions
- Regular database backups with encryption

## Environment Security

### Environment Variables
- Never commit .env files to version control
- Use different secrets for different environments
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Use a secrets management system in production

### Container Security
- Use non-root users in containers
- Keep base images updated
- Scan images for vulnerabilities
- Use multi-stage builds to minimize attack surface

## Frontend Security

### XSS Prevention
- Sanitize user inputs before rendering
- Use React's built-in XSS protection
- Validate data from APIs before displaying
- Use Content Security Policy headers

### Data Handling
- Never log sensitive information
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Validate all form inputs
- Use HTTPS for all API calls

## Code Security Practices

### Input Validation
- Validate all inputs at API boundaries
- Use type checking (TypeScript/Python type hints)
- Implement proper error handling
- Sanitize data before database operations

### Dependency Security
- Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use tools like npm audit and pip-audit
- Remove unused dependencies

### Secrets Management
- Never hardcode secrets in source code
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper secret rotation
- Use different secrets for different environments

## Security Testing

### Automated Security Testing
- Include security tests in CI/CD pipeline
- Use static analysis tools (ESLint security rules, bandit for Python)
- Implement dependency vulnerability scanning
- Add security-focused unit tests

### Manual Security Testing
- Regular penetration testing
- Code reviews with security focus
- Authentication and authorization testing
- Input validation testing

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Handling
- Have a documented incident response plan
- Monitor for security events
- Implement proper logging for security events
- Regular security audits and reviews

### Data Breach Response
- Immediate containment procedures
- User notification protocols
- Regulatory compliance requirements
- Post-incident analysis and improvements

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Privacy
- Implement data minimization principles
- Provide user data export/deletion capabilities
- Document data processing activities
- Consider GDPR/CCPA compliance requirements

### Audit Trail
- Log all significant user actions
- Maintain immutable audit logs
- Regular log analysis and monitoring
- Secure log storage and retention
