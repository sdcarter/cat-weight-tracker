# Testing Strategy

## 🎯 The Solution

**Local**: Container-based testing for high confidence  
**CI**: Native runtimes for speed and GitHub Actions compatibility  
**Result**: Same quality standards, optimal performance for each environment

## 🚀 Quick Commands

```bash
# High-confidence testing (recommended before pushing)
task ci-test

# Quick development feedback
task test
task lint

# Individual components
task frontend:test
task backend:test
```

## 📊 Environment Comparison

| Aspect | Local (Containers) | GitHub Actions (Native) |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Confidence** | Very High | High |
| **Speed** | Moderate | Fast |
| **Debugging** | Excellent | Good |
| **Consistency** | Production-like | Version-locked |

## ✅ Why This Works

### Local Advantages
- **Container consistency** matches production
- **Better debugging** with full environment control
- **Higher confidence** - if `task ci-test` passes, CI will pass

### CI Advantages  
- **Native Node.js 22** and **Python 3.11** for speed
- **PostgreSQL service** integration
- **Optimized for GitHub Actions** constraints

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If CI Fails But Local Passes
1. Run `task ci-test` to reproduce the issue
2. Check Node/Python versions match CI
3. Verify environment variables are set
4. Check dependency lock files are up to date

### Common Issues
```bash
# Port conflicts
task clean

# Database issues  
task db:reset

# Dependency mismatches
task deps
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

**The Reality**: GitHub Actions doesn't have docker-compose by default, so we built a hybrid approach:

- **Local**: Full container stack with Task commands
- **CI**: Native runtimes with same test commands
- **Quality**: Identical standards and expectations

## 🎉 Bottom Line

Your local tests are **more comprehensive** than CI. If `task ci-test` passes locally, CI will pass too! This gives you higher confidence while maintaining fast CI feedback.

**Workflow**: `task ci-test` → `git push` → ✅ CI passes
